This directory consists of supplementary files for the manuscript "Dissecting Metabolic Landscape of Alveolar Macrophages". The files in this directory are titled to delineate the content. The files in the manuscript are as below:
S1 File: List of reactions, metabolites and gene associations in the generated GSM models of healthy alveolar macrophage, M1 phase, and M2 phase in excel format.
S2 File: SBML/ mat files for healthy and activated alveolar macrophage GSM model from different integration techniques.
S3 File: GSM Model composition comparison from all the integration methods and the validation table including the metabolic capabilities of each activated phases.
S4 File: An excel file containing the flux comparison of the highlighted pathways.
S5 File: GSEA Analysis Results for the transcriptomics data.
S6 File: Excel file containing details regarding the constraints on the reactions that allow the switch of M2 to M1 phenotype.
S7 File: Excel file containing results obtained from metabolite centric analysis and M1 and M2 correlation network matrices.
S8 File: GAMS and python code for Meta Shift Optimizer.
S9 File: Excel file containing the details on the dataset such as number of samples and the preview of the normalized data.
S10 File: Flux Sum Analysis Results for the three condition of M1 and M2 phase.
